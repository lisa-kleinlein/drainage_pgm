# Evaluation of influences on the drainage of the river Isar and its inflows in successive catchments

## Research Question

How do climatological and hydrological variables influence river drainage in four partially consecutive catchments in Bavaria, particularly when explaining low drainage values?

## Data

Climex-II data from the Geography Department of the LMU, which is not publicly available.

Simulated data at 4 river gauges in Mittenwald, Bad TÃ¶lz and Munich (located at the Isar river) and Schlehdorf  (located at the Loisach river) between 1981 and 2010; 3-hourly values of drainage, air temperature, global radiation, groundwater depth, precipitation, infiltration, relative humidity, snow storage, soil water in the root zone and soil water in the unsaturated zone (influencing variables as rolling means for different number of days).

## Used Methods

* Descriptive Analysis:
  - Tables and graphics of variables' measures
  - Bivariate Copulas of influencing variables with respective drainage
  - Empirical lower and upper tail dependence for influencing variables and respective drainage
* Modelling:
  - Separate GAMs for catchments and hydrological halfyears for a given influence structure
    (Distribution assumption: Gaussian or Gamma, log link;
     Linear predictor: Linear effects for year and drainage of previous catchments, B-Splines for influencing variables, two linear interactions for influencing variables;
     Distribution assumption and linear interactions are chosen, which most improve the mean squared error (MSE) for drainage values below a specific threshold called NM7Q, on a second simulation series)
* Model evaluation:
  - Effect plots for influencing variables
  - Change in expected drainage for two specific scenarios concerning air temperature and precipitation
  - Pedictions of drainage on a third simulation series
